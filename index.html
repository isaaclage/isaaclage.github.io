                <p><b>Teaching and Research Interests:</b> In my research, I am interested in developing interactive optimization methods to train machine learning models to operate in sociotechnical contexts. As a teacher and mentor, I am excited about creating learning experiences that are accessible, and that emphasize both technical computer science skills and skills for understanding and communicating the implications of computing systems.

            <p id="experience">
                <p><b>Experience:</b> I am a final year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Harvard with <a href="https://finale.seas.harvard.edu/">Professor Finale Doshi-Velez</a>, where my work has been supported by an NSF GRFP fellowship.  I completed an internship at Microsoft Research in Summer 2020 in the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/adaptive-systems-and-interaction/">Adaptive Systems and Interaction Group</a> where I was supervised by <a href="https://www.ecekamar.com/">Dr. Ece Kamar</a>.  Before starting my PhD, I worked with <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/dsontag/">Professor David Sontag</a> as a Research Software Engineer at MIT and NYU.  I earned a B.A. in Computer Science and <a href="https://as.nyu.edu/soca/about.html">Social & Cultural Analysis</a> from NYU in 2016.</p>

                <p><b>Service and Outreach:</b>
                I participated in the development and analysis of the initial Harvard SEAS (School of Engineering and Applied Sciences) <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/media/75436/download">Climate Survey</a> as a member of the SEAS Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging committee.  I have also participated as a mentor in several programs aimed at students from underrepresented groups in STEM including the <a href="https://www.try-ai.org/home">Try-AI mentoring program</a> and the <a href="https://www.widscambridge.org/">Women in Data Science Cambridge workshop</a>.</p>
